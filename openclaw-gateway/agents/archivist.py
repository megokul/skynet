        Initialize runtime dependencies and object state.
        
        Purpose:
        - Implement `__init__` within this module's workflow.
        - Keep behavior localized so callers have one stable entrypoint.
        
        How it works:
        - Consumes declared inputs, performs local validation/transforms, and applies the function logic.
        - Produces deterministic return data or side effects expected by calling code.
        
        Why this exists:
        - Prevents duplicated logic in upstream orchestration paths.
        - Improves debuggability by centralizing this behavior in one named function.
        
        Parameters:
        - `db`: input used by this function to compute or route work.
